## 📊 Dataset Description
The system utilizes a structured dataset containing movies, users, and ratings, primarily modeling the architecture of the **MovieLens Dataset**.

### Dataset Structure:
| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **User ID** | Unique identifier for each user |
| **Movie ID** | Unique identifier for each movie |
| **Movie Title** | The name of the film |
| **Movie Genres** | Categories (Action, Sci-Fi, Drama, etc.) |
| **User Ratings** | Numeric score given by users |
| **Timestamp** | Date and time of the rating |
| **Search Queries** | History of movie titles searched by users |
| **Industry Trends** | Distribution of movies across global industries |

## ⚙️ Methodology
The recommendation engine follows a systematic six-step pipeline:

1.  **Data Collection**: Loading the dataset (e.g., MovieLens).
2.  **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and normalization.
3.  **Feature Extraction**: Identifying key attributes like genres and user preferences.
4.  **Model Building**: Implementing recommendation algorithms.
5.  **Model Training**: Training models on historical user interaction data.
6.  **Prediction**: Generating personalized movie lists for users.

### 1. Content-Based Filtering (Implemented)
Analyzes movie features using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to recommend films from global industries (Hollywood, Bollywood, Regional).

### 2. Collaborative Filtering (Implemented)
Predicts a user's interest by identifying patterns using user-to-user similarity matrices from historical ratings.

### 3. Hybrid Recommendation System (Implemented)
**The Gold Standard**: Our primary engine. It merges Content-Based scores with Collaborative Filtering predictions (50/50 weighting) to deliver highly personalized "Confidence Matches".
